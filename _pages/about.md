title: About
subtitle: I'm Scott, and for as long as I can remember I've loved to build things. What started with Legos and Knex has grown into over a decade of experience building & launching software products. I have been the technical cofounder of four startups and an early engineering employee at several more. My sweet spot is full-stack web development, and my recent work has been focused on Generative AI.
