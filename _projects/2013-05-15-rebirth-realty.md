## Description

Rebirth Realty is unlike all the other projects on this because it was primarily IRL. No apps for this one, just good old elbow grease and a lot of nights and weekends.

We purchased the house in the tax auction after it had sat vacant for over a decade. It's a classic Detroit real estate story – the house had seven bedrooms and we bought it for $8k.
